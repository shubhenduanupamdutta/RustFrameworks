# Core Concepts of Tokio
-----------
- ### Tokio Runtime
    - Tokio runtime is the environment that executes asynchronous tasks.
    - It is responsible for:
        - Scheduling tasks.
        - Polling futures.
        - Reacting to I/O events.
- ### Futures
    - Futures are asynchronous computations that represent eventual completion of a task.
    - Futures are lazy and do not start executing until they are polled.
    - Futures are polled by the Tokio runtime.
- ### Async/Await
    - Async/Await is a syntax that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code, it makes asynchronous code more readable and intuitive.
    - It is built on top of futures and is a more ergonomic way to write asynchronous code.
